# Hibernate_service_Registry_BootStrapping

# Service : 
Services are classes that provide Hibernate with pluggable implementations of various types of functionality. 
Specifically they are implementations of certain service contract interfaces 

# ServiceRegistry :

The central service API, aside from the services themselves, is the org.hibernate.service.ServiceRegistry interface. The main purpose of a service registry is to hold, manage and provide access to services.
